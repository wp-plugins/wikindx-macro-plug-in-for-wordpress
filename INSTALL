Installation Instructions
=========================

Place the "wikindx.php" file into your "plugins" directory in WordPress, or
your "mu-plugins" directory in WordPress MU.  In the file, replace
"http://path.to/wikindx/" with the URL to your WIKINDX installation.  

You may have to activate the plug-in from your WordPress administrative
control panel.

Please see README for instructions on how to use the module.

Kses Hack
=========

Depending on how your WordPress is configured, you may need to use a
so-called "kses hack".  (You'll know you need this if all the "wikindx"
tags get stripped when you save your post.)

There are several ways to do this.  It doesn't matter which way you use,
but be sure to do it in a way that is compatible with other plug-ins.

For example, you can merge the following code into the file
"wp-includes/kses.php", or place it into a "kses-hack.php" in your
"plugins" or "mu-plugins" directory:

if (!CUSTOM_TAGS) {
	$allowedposttags['wikindx'] = array(
		'resource' => array()
	);
}
