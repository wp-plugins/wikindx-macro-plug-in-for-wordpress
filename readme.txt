Adds a macro to WordPress to insert bibliography information from the WIKINDX bibliography management system.

The plug-in will probably work for versions lower than 2.7.x, but I haven't tested it for those versions.

== Description ==

This plug-in adds a macro that can be used to insert bibliography information from the [WIKINDX](http://wikindx.sourceforge.net/) bibliography management system into a WordPress post.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wikindx.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory (or the `/wp-content/mu-plugins` directory).
1. You may have to activate the plug-in through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of the plug-in in action.
