1. Installation
===============

For installation instructions, please see the file named INSTALL.

2. Usage
========

The plug-in creates a new macro "wikindx" with one parameter "resource", 
which can be used inside WordPress posts like this:

<wikindx resource="123" />

In the above, replace 123 with the resource ID of the bibliography entry whose
information you want.  (This ID can be found in the URL of the resource's page
on WIKINDX.)  The result is that the macro is replaced by the bibliographical
information for that resource.

This plug-in can be used to good effect with Rob Miller's Footnotes plug-in for
WordPress ( http://robm.me.uk/projects/plugins/wordpress/footnotes ), like
this:

<ref name="ABC"><wikindx resource="123" /></ref>
